The following report is an investigation into how different statistical measures can be used for attribution of authorship.
By looking at a variety of statistical measures the report will evaluate the difference in authorship between three known
texts of Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, and Charlotte Bronte. Furthermore, through building a Random Forrest classifier
the report will attempt to classify an unknown text to one of the known authors using the statistical measures evaluated.

I submitted this paper for a final year statistics assignemnt (2022) at the University of Sheffield in which I was awarded a first (exact mark unknown). 
To get the data I donwloaded several chapters of books from each author, and then used python to process the data and create a data frame witch each sentance and the corresponding author as an individual row. Technologies include: python, pandas, jupyter notebook, scikit-learn, numpy, seaborn.
