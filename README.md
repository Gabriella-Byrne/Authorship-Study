I submitted this paper for a final year statistics assignemnt at the University of Sheffield in which I was awarded a first (exact mark unknown).

The following report is an investigation into how different statistical measures can be used for attribution of authorship.
By looking at a variety of statistical measures the report will evaluate the difference in authorship between three known
texts of Jane Austen, Emily Bronte, and Charlotte Bronte. Furthermore, through building a Random Forrest classifier
the report will attempt to classify an unknown text to one of the known authors using the statistical measures evaluated.
